**Project Overview:**

You are tasked with working on a simplified version of our game
"Calming Word Puzzles".

To start working with the project clone or download the git repository
located in the following address
https://github.com/cagatayg/SoftTowelCase2024.git .
Project is created using Unity Editor 2022.3.17f1.

The provided unity project includes a language selection page, a main
menu, and an in-game screen. It encompasses 20 levels for three
languages (English, German, and Turkish).

The in-game screen already has logic implemented to read level data and
generate puzzles. For ease of understanding and debugging, three
functional editor buttons have been added: "Previous Level", "Next
Level", and "Find Word."

**Expectations for this Case Study:**

**1. Word Assembly Using the Letter Wheel:**

-   Allow the user to form words by dragging and combining letters using the letter wheel.

-   Evaluate the formed word when dragging is completed, and if correct, fill the puzzle. If incorrect, provide the user with a small animation as negative feedback.

**2. Bonus Word Recognition:**

-   At the end of word formation by the user, identify bonus words specified in the level data but not present in the puzzle.

-   If the formed word is indeed a bonus word specified in the level data, provide the user with a small animation to highlight the situation in which the word is correct but not included in the current puzzle. (Example: word letters fly to the bonus words button at the bottom left of the letter wheel).

**3. Level Completion:**

-   Upon completing a level, congratulate the user with a popup and reward them with 50 coins.

-   Include a "Continue" button on the popup, allowing the user to proceed to the next level upon clicking.

**4. Game State Persistence:**

-   If the user presses the back button during gameplay or exits the game, reload the found puzzle words and bonus words when re-entering the level.

**Bonus Tasks:**

-   On the in-game screen, you will find a "bonus words" button at the bottom left of the letter wheel. When this button is pressed display a popup listing the bonus words found within the level.

-   On the in-game screen, you will find a shuffle button at the center of the letter wheel. Implement the functionality to shuffle the letters on the wheel when pressed.

-   On the in-game screen, a hint button is located at the top right of the letter wheel. Implement the functionality to reveal a random letter for 100 coins when pressed.

**Notes and Tips:**

1.  Functionality takes precedence in our evaluation criteria. Visual aesthetics can be prioritized secondary if needed.

2.  Examine existing class structures and project structure within the project and try to utilize them as much as possible.

3.  Develop clean and well-documented code. Include comments explaining key functionalities and decision-making.

4.  Provide a brief overview of your implementation choices.

5.  You can use the added images and other assets in the project, or if preferred, integrate your own assets. Ensure your assets are royalty-free.
